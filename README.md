# Hi, welcome to Alvaro's GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Alvaro Menduina-Fernandez** and I'm an Astrophysics DPhil student at the University of Oxford. I'm working on the HARMONI instrument, the Integral Field Spectrograph for the European Extremely Large Telescope [E-ELT](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/eelt/).

## Quick Bio

I'm from Madrid, Spain and I'm interested in all things _Space_. After completing my BSc in Aerospace Engineering, I moved to the Netherlands for my MSc in Aerospace Engineering (Space Flight track) at TU Delft. I did an internship and my MSc Thesis at OHB Munich, developing software for the design of space optical instruments with freeform optics.

In 2017, I moved from satellites in _Space_ looking down on Earth, to telescopes on Earth looking into _Space_ when I began my DPhil in Astrophysics at Oxford ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. Now on my final year, I've spent the last 3+ years researching how to calibrate **Non-Common Path Aberrations** (NCPA) for instruments like HARMONI.

## What do I use GitHub for?

There are many aspects of my DPhil Thesis that involve coding, so I spend most of my times pushing commits to GitHub. What keeps me busy?

* **Machine Learning**: a big part of my research focuses on developing Machine Learning techniques for the calibration of NCPA. Find more about it in my [Repo](https://github.com/AlvaroMenduina/NCPA).
* **End-to-End Model Simulations**: Within the HARMONI project, I'm in charge of developing a Python package to analyse the performance of End-to-End Models of the HARMONI instrument. These are optical models of the complete instrument, which I use to evaluate the performance and prove that HARMONI will work. You can find more about this in my [Repo](https://github.com/AlvaroMenduina/E2E).
* **Data Reduction**: I'm currently running an experiment with an optical bench that generates lots of exciting data. \[**COMING SOON**\]
